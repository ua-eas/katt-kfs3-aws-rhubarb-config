      DATE TIME - The request to execute the Asset Depreciation Batch Job has
      been received, but has been placed on hold. Please review the KFS parameter
      DEPRECIATION_RUN_DATE found within the KFS-CAM namespace to ensure it is set
      appropriately for the job to run as desired.
      
      After the parameter has been reviewed and the adjustment has been completely
      approved, as necessary, please contact the KFS technical support team for the
      Asset Depreciation Batch Job to be released for execution. If the tech team
      does not receive notification today to release the job for processing, the
      nightly batch processing will be held up until that event occurs.
